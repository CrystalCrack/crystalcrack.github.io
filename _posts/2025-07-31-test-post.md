## Welcome to the Test Post

This post is designed to verify that your Jekyll site is up and running correctly. If you can see this page, it means your basic setup, including the theme and GitHub Pages deployment, is working.

Now, let's check some common Markdown elements to ensure they are styled correctly by your theme.

### Text Formatting

First, let's test some basic text formatting.

This is a standard paragraph. It should be easily readable. Here is some **bold text** to grab attention, and some _italic text_ for emphasis. You can also combine them to get ***bold and italic text***. We can also use `inline code` for variable names or short snippets.

### Lists

Lists are essential for organizing information.

**Unordered List:**
* Item one: Check the bullet point style.
* Item two: Check the indentation and spacing.
    * A nested item.
    * Another nested item.
* Item three: The final item in the list.

**Ordered List:**
1.  First item: Ensure numbers are rendered correctly.
2.  Second item: The sequence should be automatic.
3.  Third item: Each item should have consistent margins.

### Blockquote

Blockquotes are great for highlighting quotes or important notes.

> "The advance of technology is based on making it fit in so that you don't really even notice it, so it's part of everyday life."
> â€” Bill Gates

Check if the blockquote has a distinct style, like a border, background color, or different font style.

### Code Block

For technical blogs, code blocks are crucial. This is a syntax-highlighted code block for JavaScript. Your theme should apply colors to different parts of the code.

```javascript
// A simple function to say hello
function greet(name) {
  // Check for null or undefined name
  if (!name) {
    name = 'World';
  }
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

// Call the function
greet('Developer');
